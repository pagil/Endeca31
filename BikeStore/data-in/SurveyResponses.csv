SO43675|My wife and I went nuts ordering everything we need to become bike enthusiasts.  Mr. Reiter was more than patient as we learned about all that was needed, although I am sure the size of our order helped.  He even threw in assembly.  We can't wait to try it out, everything looks like top quality.
SO43873|Linda continues to be a very supportive account manager for all my biking needs with your company's product line.  I do business with your company as a direct result of her professionalism and knowledge of the product line.
SO43902|I run a small specialty shop in a small mid-western town. The ability to quickly identify and order replacement parts as well as new bike models is critical to my business. Tete did a great job of guiding me through what to me is a large order in record time. Keep this one!
SO44098|Tsvi, one of your sales reps, couldn't spend a minute helping me find a bike that is right for my body type and riding style.  Everytime I asked him a question about a Road Frame he looked at me with blank stares and would say "bikes over there".  I wanted to know what the difference in color and sizes were but he didn't help.  He couldn't sell honey to bees.
SO44133|The bike frames were as-expected. I did my research via other stores before I purchased. The sports shorts fit well and were comfortable. The Long-sleeve logo jersey, however, irritated my nipples after a half hour of wear.  David was a great rep. He answered all my questions, and best of all, he didn't push add-on components that I didn't need. Thanks for the service.
SO44285|When it came to analyzing some women's mountain shorts, Ms Carson really was a big help.  
SO44288|We had a horrendous experience. The parts were sub-quality and some of them are outright dangerous. The jerseys we ordered (and we ordered many) were all flimsy and started to show signs of tearing apart after the very first time we used them. The gloves were advertised as water-proof, but THEY WERE NOT. The hydration pack had a hole in it - can you believe it? The helmet seems to be built of cheap plastic.  Experience with Tete was OK - he seemed pushy and just wanted to get done with us. Now we are dealing with the Amanda in the support to RETURN all the items and that is turning out to be another mess. We are never going to come back and shop here - it is better to buy from big brands who actually care a little about their reputation.
SO44294|I'd would be hard-pressed to recommend buying gloves from this bike shop.  Their prices were much higher than what I saw offered by a competitor, and after I informed them of this, they did not offer to match the lower price. 
SO44313|Jillian really knows her stuff!  She helped me find the bikes and accessories I needed, would buy again.
SO44314|I needed to quickly stock up on items for my next road race, and Jillian helped me get exactly what I needed.  Delivery was immediate and complete, and Jillian even called the day after to make sure I felt like a champion.  Great service!
SO44498|Jose was a great rep.  He pointed me to your website to learn more about the pedals I was buying, but the site was very slow.
SO44514|I placed a huge order with Michael Blythe -- the sales order ran onto 35 items. Michael was very helpful during the ordering process, being knowledgeable about the parts and flexible in his pricing as the order size grew. However, once the order was placed, I found him less responsive to follow-up requests, about shipping times and dealing with a mis-shipped item. I'd buy from the store again, but I'd prefer a sales person who cares about the customer, not just the deal.
SO44530|I'm afraid I bought the hard sell re the Mountain brand from the rep. Subsequent experience has shown me that there are better brands with higher reliability. The purchase meets my immediate needs however, and I will learn from experience.
SO44552|can't pronounce his name but Tsvi Reiter was very helpful and pleasant.  The parts were delivered on time.  Great service.
SO44782|What a great experience I had at AdventureWorks.  I had a very old bike which is no longer manufactured.  After having gone to many specialty shops (both brick and mortar and online) I still couldn't find the replacement frame I desperately needed.  After speaking to Jose, he immediately knew about the bike in question and while it would take a few weeks to order, AdventureWorks could certainly provide me the frame.  In fact, I received the frame a few days early in time for my upcoming race!  
SO44784|Jae Pak was awesome.  He knew everything about your catalog.  I will say that your sizes run small so I may be forced to get my bike clothing from a competitor next year.
SO45069|Ranjit helped me find all the stuff I needed.  Awesome purchase experience.
SO45075|I like the bike. I like the store.
SO45291|Never worked with Amy before, but she was efficient in putting together an order with everything on our list.  Delivery was a bit patchy, but not all the equipment was in stock when we ordered and at least we received the in-stock items quickly.  Only one frame had a bent mounting bracket, but probably not due to packaging.  Amy helped us get an exchange without extra shipping costs.
SO45342|First of all I want to say I love the long sleeve logo jersey.  It's great on both warm and cold weather rides and looks great.  Also, Linda Mitchell was awesome.  She walked me through all the options and was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Great experience!
SO45529|Tsvi is awesome!  The bike parts are awesome.  The price was awesome. signed captain awesome
SO45548|Simply the best site for cycling resellers.  David quickly understood what I products I needed based on the type of clients I sell to.  He not only directed me to the ideal products but also offered some of the best shipping and return policies in the industry.  I will be returning often.
SO45555|The long sleeve logo jersey rocks!  I love the breathable material, plus it's super-easy to clean.
SO45560|Not the best experience.  Jillian was not as well educated as I hoped and expected.  I left not quite knowing if I got the right parts. Only time will tell.
SO45574|I'm so pleased with my new mountain bike and the support I received from Amy during the sale. When I realized that I'd mistakenly ordered a size XL jersey and small tights, she even helped me get the right sizes. I'll definitely be back -- I need to order some toe clips, head and tail lights so I can ride safely.
SO46036|
SO46057|Jillian is a great rep, ask for her by name. She took a ton of time to help me pick just the right stuff. It showed up today and I cannot wait till the weekend to put this bad boy together.
SO46338|After much discussion with Jae I decided on the ML Mountain Rear Wheel. It fit my bike perfectly and really helps on that rough terrain. I plan to be back when I save up enough to afford the HL Fork! 
SO46607|So the chain you shipped me today was bent and will not fit on my gears... how do I return this?
SO46633|The HL Touring Frame has met my expectations.  While it's a little heavier than the LL Touring Frame, the additional weight is not a problem.  I expect to get many years of riding out of this frame.
SO46643|hi Jae, thank you so much for your help last week. u were really helpful and fixed my mistake with my online bike clothes order. thanks again paul
SO46647|I had a problem with the LL Mountain Pedal, which was damaged during shipping, but Jay Pack was very helpful getting the return executed for me. He turned was I expected to be a annoying return process into a simple transaction. Thanks!
SO46660|Jillian knows mountain bikes.  The 200, 300 and the 400, she knows them all.  Top gear speed, brake pressure, handle tourque.  I felt like I just graduated from Mountain University.  I got an HL Mountain Frame - Silver and a ML Headset and I couldn't be happier.  Especially since Jillian helped me picked out the right frame.
SO46930|The Hydration Pack leaks. Weak.
SO46936|After many attempts to acquire the proper frame size, and color, I did ultimately get the Yellow Panda 10speed I had been always wanted in size 48. There really is no other bike I'd want, and so glad Tsvi was able to get it for me. It goes great with my racing socks.
SO46957|Hello, I bought a yellow touring-3000 bike from Jose.  Mr. Sariava was a pleasure to talk to and he was a very pleasant sales person.  However, he was not very knowledgeable about the product.  The bike, on the other hand, is an awesome peddler as a commuting tool.  The number of available and configurable parts for the bike is astounding.  I am very happy that I bought it.  Happy cycling.  Brad Pitt
SO46964|My husband and I wanted to update our bikes so I started my shopping at AdventureWorks.com  My  shopping experience was excellent! Jillian had a broad knowledge of their products and worked with me to fill my shopping cart with all the things I wanted.  When I'm back in the market for bike equipment upgrades I'll be sure to come back!  Thanks!
SO46965|My sales representative, Tsvi Reiter, was very helpful.  He listened to my needs and asked me more questions that allowed him to guide me to the bike products that would best satisfy my requirements.  The entire transaction took much less time that I expected (less than 15 minutes).  The parts were delivered in a timely manner.  I was very satisfied with my experience and will shop here again.
SO46966|Lynn Tsoflias was great. She helped me find all the Touring parts I needed and couldn't find on other sites. I think she got a couple of upsells on me (jersey and cap), but I needed those anyway. Thank again... will shop here again.
SO46991|Michael is a good guy.  I can tell he's a real bicycle enthusiast.  Makes buying the bike a fun experience.
SO46992|I purchased an HL Fork (SO47042) for my Trek (GF) Montare hybrid from Tsvi R.  He was very helpful in explaining the differences between this fork and the LL Fork (SO47042).  Couldn't be happier.  The remote lock-out feature is fantastic and it was well forth the extra $.  Thanks Tsvi!
SO46996|Quite honestly, Pamela wasn't very good when it came to picking out bike socks.  Did she just start yesterday?
SO47000|Linda was a little too helpful: she constantly filled my ear with deep, deep details of handlebars and frames.  I felt overwhelmed; I didn't need all the details, just some help pricing the items.
SO47018|Linda was not that helpfull... she told me these parts would fit together and they don't. Know I have to package all this up and send it back, you guys better pay for the shipping...
SO47033|Finally getting around to reviewing the Touring-2000 I bought last month. Overall I am very pleased with the improved performance and rigidity over my old one. This frame is also a lot lighter both in actual weight and how it feels while riding. Highly recommend this frame. Also the sales rep Syed that helped me was very knowledgeable about competitive products, which helped me decide on this one. 
SO47034|This Hitch Rack is perfect for what I need it for; driving around all our bikes including two kids size bike. It's discreet, which is nice, but it's not very stable: I have to keep the front brake engaged (by increasing the cable tension at the barrel adjuster) to keep the bike from upright. Otherwise, the fork rotates against the front wheel, the frame starts to tip, and the stand twists out from underneath. Also, it leaves black marks on my car. But it's the best solution I've found for my application.  I think Syed made a the right call when he recommended the product, although it was very difficult to understand him at times because of his accent.
SO47052| I came in to buy a bell for my handlebar and ended up purchasing 50 things.  Talk about a great sales person.  I'll probably return most of the items, but just wanted to let you know that my experience was excellent.
SO47061|Amy was terrible, she talked on her cell phone the whole time I was standing at the counter.  It was like I was a huge bother.  Very poor customer service.
SO47066|Jillian was very professional and return all my calls promptly.  All of my orders were fulfilled to satisfaction and delivered on time.
SO47377|Garrett was very responsive to every question asked with regard to my orders.  He had a strong knowledge of the Touring product lines and guided me in the right direction a number of times. Garrett was also able to expedite one of my clothing orders for a long sleeve shirt to get the gear in time for one of our family vacations.  
SO47384|I made a significant purchase today for my cycling team’s annual European touring trip. The Sales Rep, Jae Pak, was helpful, but had limited information about how the touring frames could be modified to support the varied requirements of triathlon and time trial enthusiasts on our team.  He was able to recommend good panniers and gear that will meet our needs to ride from Stockholm to Budapest in August. 
SO47408|
SO47439|I needed a replacement rear derailleur for my touring bike but didn't know what I should buy. Mr. Campbell the sales rep was very knowledgeable and was able to hep me find the item I was looking for!
SO47457|What a great experience!  Amy was super helpful and helped me find exactly what I was looking for.  I'll definitely come back!
SO47685|I called Pamela twice trying to return the LL mountain pedal due to damage. Pamela wasn't very helpful; in the end, I went to get an answer on the internet forum on what to do.
SO47703|Jae Pak is a great sales rep but he only knows the Touring products.  He couldn't tell me anything about a Hussy and when I asked he would just scoff.  Sure the HL Touring is professional favorite but nothing has the simplicity and value as a Hussey.  Jae should be kinder to customers.  Even if I became a Touring fan, I wouldn't buy from Jae.
SO47706|Linda was great! Her knowledge and enthusiasm made this whole process a lot easier, and made my partner less upset about spending so much money! 
SO47716|The Full Finger gloves saved me this winter and I would not have purchased them if Jae Pak didn't recommend them to me.
SO47721|Michael convinced me to get the "Classic Vest," saying that it would block wind and keep my core warm. Unfortunately, it does neither. I'm really disappointed in this purchase, especially since I've had such good luck at this store in the past. It's one thing for a manufacturer to make a bad product, but a totally different thing for a person to explicitly recommend that product! I'm going to think twice before buying from here again... or at least think twice before taking Michael's recommendations.
SO48005|I was a little disappointed with David Campbell's customer service.  I was hoping to get outfitted with an entirely new set of gear, including a biking outfit, so I called David to discuss my options.  We nailed down a few different options, and he was very knowledgeable.  Then, I told him I wasn't sure of my clothing size, and would have to get back in contact with him to complete the order.  Unfortunately, there was a miscommunication - David ordered the clothes we discussed, but ordered 1 of each size!  I had to return the clothes that didn't fit, at my expense.
SO48012|Your store has a wide selection and great prices, and my order was well packaged and shipped quickly.  However, I knew exactly what I needed and your sales rep, Ms. Valdez, continually tried to persuade me to purchase more than I requested, which frustrated the experience.
SO48021|The bike parts have proved very durable. The rep met all my needs, and I found him very knowledgeable.
SO48053|Bought the Road 650 in black this week and love it already. Michael (the sales rep) was very helpful in determining which was the right model and size for me. Very pleased overall. Price seemed competitive relative to other places I looked. 
SO48057|Jose did not know the first thing about bicycles.  He could not answer any of my questions.
SO48071|Tsvi helped me get some Women's Tights for my wife (L) and daughter (S).  They are avid riders but always get their sweat pants stuck in the gears.  Tsvi assured me that these tights are comfortable and a customer favorite.  Some how I ended up buying an AWC hat as well but overall I had a good shopping experience with him.
SO48073|Michael knows his stuff.  I'd come back again.
SO48310|had some trouble remembering the model numbers of the yellow frames, lynn looked them on the fly and we got the hookup
SO48313|I am new to the world of mountain biking and needed to get all of the gear necessary to hit the trail.  Tete was very knowledgeable and helped my girlfriend and I select complete biking kits.  My first weekend on the trails convinced me I made a good decision.  I would encourage any newcomers to the sport to make AdventureWorks their first stop.
SO48338|I was riding my bike the first day after getting it and the first time I went for a monster huck my handle bars came off!  Needless to say I did not land the huck, though I did land in the hospital, and you will be hearing from my lawyers!!!!!
SO48347|The most affordable tires on the web.  Very pleased with my purchase.
SO48392|Love the new bike.  Finished well in my first race on it.  I would love to pick up a sponsor.  You guys interested?  Call me.
SO48753|Ranjit Chudukatil was late responding to all of my calls.  One order (SO47377) never arrived.  After calling him multiple times, the oder was shipped again again and arrived over 60 days late.  I was very not happy with his inability to respond quickly to my concerns.
SO49066|Jae was fountain of knowledge on all things mountain biking.  He helped me select bike frames for myself and wife.  He was also able to recommend the best pair of bike gloves I have ever worn.  I will definitely be coming back to AdventureWorks for all my biking needs.
SO49099|I had mixed feelings about my experience with Garrett, or "Varg" as he preferred to be called.  I mean, he didn't even know the correct bike frame size to give me; he said I was a 60 when I'm clearly a 62.  Thank God for Lance Armstrong and his Livestrong site (http://www.livestrong.com/article/185328-how-to-determine-road-bike-frame-size/).Despite his obvious need for additional training, Varg was friendly with my wife and kids and did a nice job helping them pick out helmets.     
SO49169|There were a couple of hiccups with my order, but Jae Pak really went above and beyond to make sure that things were remedied as quickly and painlessly as possible.  The main issue was the the items shipped were incorrect for a couple of the apparel items.  Jae Pak expressed the new items and the experience didn't interrupt my usage at all.
SO49464|Really happy with my with my new Road 550 bike.  I was replacing a carbon fiber Specialized frame, which cracked when I tightened the seat to tightly. I was a little disappointed that the Road-550 bike wasn't available in blue, but Jae from the shop assured me this was a great bike, and the price was right. I was able to transfer most of the my components except my aerobars, and got the HL Road Handlebars and some new Dura Ace shifters. Mr. Pak also took the time to make sure the fit was right, since the Specialized frame sizes are not measured in centimeters (just S, M, L, etc). Also threw in a discount on some socks and gloves.
SO49527|Most of my items were ok in my order, but I had a terrible experience with my 30 oz water bottle, it had a huge hole in the bottom, and no opening in the top! What a terrible design. I called Jae Pak to get it replaced and she said that I was holding it upside down, but was willing to refund my money. 
SO49540|Garrett made my experience really great.  Really great.  Is he married? Kidding!  I love my bike.
SO49860|Those racing socks were amazing -- I would not have purchased two pairs in different sizes if this wasn't recommended by Tsvi, my sales representative. He explained why it is helpful to have an additional pair that is one size larger than the one I need. Thank you.
SO49894|I've been looking around for a while, and the price was right here.  I was in and out very quickly since I knew what I needed. I'll be recommending you to my friends!
SO50218|I love my AWC Logo Cap, Jillian really helped me to pick out the right color. Mrs Carson also helped me to select a great matching Long Sleeve Logo Jersey, which fit perfectly.
SO50225|
SO50231|When I asked Jose the sales rep about the difference between the Touring 3000 and 2000 models, he basically lied to me and told me that the 3000 frame was made of 7005 aluminum. I oredered a number of 3000 frames because of that. When they arrived, I discovered that they were made of the same 6061 alloy as the 2000 frames. I am currently stuck dealing with bureaucracy of trying to get a refund from the customer service.  I hope Jose got a good commission off this sale because I will not be coming back!
SO50245|Bike is awesome!
SO50259|David Campbell is a very knowledgeable guy when it comes to mountain biking and the ultimate recommendation he made turned out great. I love my new bike. I rode it hard this weekend around my local 10 mile trail loop and it performed well in very wet and slippery conditions. My new bike very durable and strong but is as light as a feather. I think it will easily handle the 120-150 miles per week that I intend to put in over the next year or so. I highly recommend this product. The shorts are great too.
SO50261|JP was super helpful for the most part.  Sometimes he could be a bit pushy, but overall a great level of care.  For example, when I brought the AWC Logo Cap back as it was fraying a little, he was totally able to replace the item on the spot but he did try and sell me a bunch of other things that I didn't really need!
SO50311|I was looking for a pair of bike shorts with padding to help avoid the dreaded blisters that comes from riding on a small seat. The bib shorts are great!
SO50663|I ordered a very specific rear derailleur, and the rep asked me the right questions to be sure that it would work with my current setup. Very helpful!
SO50664|Very happy with the transaction. Will purchase again.
SO50682|I was trying to purchase HL Road Handlebars, and Linda (our rep) was very helpful. She had a recommendation for handlebar tape, and explained what the venting holes were for. Excellent service!
SO50743|My company rents mountain bikes servicing people interested in the Scenic Touring Loop in the Mahoosucs region of the Appalation Mountains. Finding the right bikes and outfittings is critical to our business. Tsvi was enormously helpful in helping us identify what would work best.
SO50748|After much research, the LL and HL Touring Frames were the right choice for me.  It is lightweight butted aluminum frame, and offers the right riding position for town riding. I'd recommend trying to get Lynn Tsoflias to help you out.  She knew all about the different frames in stock.
SO50756|The Men's Sports Shorts are total junk.  The pockets are too small, the pad is too thin, and the material feels really cheap.  Do not buy these shorts!
SO51081|One of the best sales bike experiences I have had.  The sales rep, Joe Crank, was very knowledgeable and helpful.  He explained the different options available to me and their relative pros and cons.  I didn't feel pressured, but I was well-informed.  I ended up going with the cheaper frame because it met my needs as a moderate rider and didn't bring my bank account to zero!  Joe was very pleased with and supportive of my choice.  I will definitely shop here again. 
SO51090|Linda was helpful, although I do think she convinced me to buy much more than I actually needed.  Everything came on time (one package actually arrived much earlier than expected - not sure why the shipment had to be split into two packages, though).  One item, however ("Short-Sleeve Classic Jersey") came with an ugly jagged hole in the left side.  Now I need to return it.  Sigh.  Fine experience otherwise.
SO51108|Linda Mitchell helped me with a mountain bike order. She was extremely knowledgeable and could share her own experiences in using the products we discussed. She also steered me away from products that I thought I wanted but were not a good fit. She's great!
SO51134|Having previously bought various other gear from AdventureWorks.  I decided it was time to upgrade from bikes and clothing for myself and my sister.  Shu Ito is a true enthusiast and was able to put together and outstanding combination of gear for a very reasonable price.  No regrets here.
SO51143|My experience involved too much freedom.  I have very limited ability to make decisions and this just made my purchase rather tramatic.  Please work with your sales people to provide fewer selections, it'll make bike purchases a lot more enjoyable.  By the way, the manager at your store, (Dan B.) scares customers away.
SO51149|Linda was very helpful.  She knows plenty about your product line.  The sales was simple and she knew everything I needed to know about Classic Vests.
SO51150|Great prices good service and on time delivery thank you
SO51153|First of all, you must assemble this bike yourself. I had a bit of trouble with the bike, brake positioning, gear settings, and etc. But reading the manual and making sure everything is aligned properly helped. The only down side I found to this bike is weak tubes. My advice is not to listen to Shu on this and buy a decent pair with your order, including a higher quality brakes if you live in the great mountains.
SO51691|Your sales rep Ranjit was very helpful, however when I received the ML Mountain Seat/Saddle, I found it very uncomfortable so I will be returning the product. 
SO51733|Mike is an awesome sales rep.  He not only helped me submit the order but helped me find alternative products that save me a boat load of money. Hooray to Michael Blythe :)
SO51771|I love the bike!  Jake was spot on suggesting a hybrid instead of a mountain bike for my daily commute, thank you.
SO51773|The mountain frame equipment was great, I do with you had a better selection of Urban bike parts and components, but for my Mountain rides things are working fine.  The rep was friendly and knowledgeable, if a bit overloaded with multiple clients- please get him some help! The one issue I have to complain about is a greater selection of clothes. The Izumi Pearl and Sugoi line's were very limited- particularly gloves. I am trying a small even though I am usually a medium.  Anyway thanks- I look forward to seeing you again. 
SO51783|Awesome cranksets!  And good prices, too.  Thanks, would shop here again.
SO51796|Pamela was very helpful and overall, I am happy with my purchase.  however, the Short Sleeve Classic Jersey is a much heavier material than I was expecting and doesn't seem to be moisture wicking.
SO51814|Pam helped me with my significantly large order last July when we were restocking the store for Pan Mass. She suggested a few add-ons like the headsets and minipumps that we usually don't carry- but they've been moving like hotcakes!  Thanks, will try to ask for Pam by name this summer too!
SO51815|Buying bikes for our racing team is never trivial, but Jillian has proven time and again that she is able to get it done.  Fast and professional service, complete with her usual follow-up to ensure we are satisfied.  Definitely recommend dealing with her.
SO51816|Jose is the man.  He hooked me up with some fashion forward threads that I can wear on my next millenium.  The blazing Sport 100 Helment and Long Sleeve Logo jersey are making me look tight yo.  Give Jose a raise.  The man knows how to coordinate.  
SO51822|My mountain frame showed up broken.  Shu was not very knowledgeable and knew little about his role.  He ended up talking about his girlfriend over the phone rather than dealing with my problems.
SO51831|The hitch bike rack turned out to be essential for our annual hiking trip out West! Shu was one of the best sales persons we have dealt with in the recent past. His knowledge around all things bike, especially what works well together and what not is unparalleled. We will surely come back!
SO51836|As someone new to mountain biking, I really appreciated Ranjit's help with my recent order.  I love the 42 inch Silver Mountain-200 bike I picked up a few weeks ago.  I've already ridden every possible path in the Blue Hills and the Fellsway and even put my cable lock to good use when I rode parts of the Freedom trail's cobble streets to the North End for pizza.  After blowing out a tire in front of Paul Revere's house, the minipump came in really handy.  Thanks, Adventure Works!
SO51839|The sales rep was a bit 'pushy' and I felt discounts could have been higher. The quality of the products is without doubt however.
SO51850|I have to say, it was a real pain to deal with this guy. He was very slow, and it made me really impatient and then he got grumpy with me. I would expect more profesionalism from a company like yours! Very disappointed.
SO51858|I was surprised by how sturdy the mountain bike frame is.  The welding is top-notch and the powder-coat paint job covers all exposed areas.  I would definitely recommend this frame!
SO53454|I like my new bike, but Jose was kind of weak.  Didn't seem to know as much as me.
SO53455|I was pleasantly surprised by the level of customer service I received from a member of their staff (I believe his name was Jose) while recently researching bike frames.  This gentleman had a wealth of knowledge and was able to guide me in the right direction.
SO53460|I would buy from you again
SO53467|The parts we ordered are working out great. Its not been a while so we cannot comment about the longevity, but the parts are exactly what we were looking for. We had a great experience with Rachel. She took time to understand our requirements and constraints to come up with good alternatives when the part we were looking for was not available.  Overall it was a pleasant experience and we would definitely be back for more.
SO53471|I was disappointed to discover that you don't carry matching front and rear wheels.  I ended up having to buy LL wheels instead of my favorite HLs.  Jae was nice, though.
SO53472|After destroying my Giro Xen helmet I switched to the Sport-100 Helmet.  David, the rep who helped me, said it was pretty similar in terms of weight, aerodynamics, etc. Pretty nice helmet but think I'm going to switch back to a Xen.
SO53485|I was a bit disappointed by your selection of frames.  In the end, I settled on the few that I liked, but I wish you'd expand the variety a bit.  My salesperson, Jillian C, was a bit too pushy and pressured me to make a decision.
SO53502|Can't go wrong for the price!  The seat that came with the bike was narrow and immensely painful for my wide hips, even though I only bike around our neighborhood with my kids. I did a lot of browsing before making a selection.  My sales rep Shu made it easier to go through the selection process.  I was even able to get free shipping because of my bulk order.  I would highly recommend AdventureWorks for your sporting good needs.
SO53513|Great experience.  Would do it again.  Socks fit great.  
SO53545|The rep was very patient with my large order. I'm relatively new so I appreciated his advice.
SO53550|David Campbell knows his bike gear.  He was able to recommend a set of handlebars that were much cheaper and better suited for my riding style.  Thanks for the great support!
SO53551|The order was late and the billing was wrong.  Michael was nice but I think he may be incompetent.
SO53577|I love my new bike!  The shopping experience was awesome.  My sales rep Amy really knew her bikes and got to know my riding style and preferences, so it made my decision really easy.  No question that I'd call Amy for my next bike purchase.
SO53586|My chain broke.  I ordered a new chain.  Had to wait for a week (was told it will be mailed within two days).  Got my chain.  Woo-hoo.
SO53616|A friend suggested I come here for a pair of gloves after I went on my first 50ish mile ride and came back with blisters all over my hands. Gross. I wasn't sure whether I should get full gloves or half gloves, but Jae walked me through the pros and cons of each option, and even pointed out some differences between brands. I ended up getting the half-finger gloves, and after wearing them for 4 hours today I feel confident that I made a good decision! Thanks, AdventureWorks!
SO55239|Shu was very helpful and knowledgeable.  He took his time and explained everything carefully and made helpful suggestions.  It was a great experience. Two thumbs up!
SO55248|Michael was great! Please give him a raise -- I would have made 4 or 5 mistakes placing my order if it hadn't been for him.
SO55285|AdventureWorks was great!  Everything shipped on time and in great condition.  And wow! Jillian should be employee of the month for setting me up with everything I need.  I particularly love my Water Bottle - 30 oz.
SO55294|Ms. Carson took too long to deliver my racing socks.  She didn't understand what the inventory problems were so I had to temporarily take my business elsewhere.
SO55297|Yet again another successful order with Jillian.  Business has been great, and we'll definitely be back for more.

SO57015|Happy with the entire purchasing experience, you guys rock!
SO57017|For an admittedly new employee, Tsvi had a good global understanding of your product lines, and followed up on any questions. I do wonder why you guys have such high turnover of reps though!
SO57023|good packing, fast shipping. prices okay--cheaper than wheelworks, but not as good as nashbar. might try again for finger gloves since you guys have better selection than most.
SO57046|When I called to place a new order, your sales rep Jillian Carson was kind of unpleasant. It seemed like something was really bothering her. She was helpful, but again seemed to want to end the call as soon as possible. The products I ordered were fine. I really like the Mountain-500 Silver. Very good bike.
SO57088|My new Sport-100 Helmet saved my life!  Garrett thank you for insisting I buy it.
SO57122|Michael was great. We were able to find the parts fast and they were exactly what we wanted. The parts are working fine right now but we will know more once we use them a bit.  One request is to have good visibility to the shipping status  thanks
SO57133|I did some online research on my purchase, so I knew what the capablities were before coming into the store.  Your rep knew his stuff inside and out and validated what I read - thank you!
SO57157|David was super helpful in selecting and purchasing the items I needed for our family reunion ride.  We got bike supplies perfect for everyone, from baby to grandma!  I especially love the beautiful half-finger gloves I got... David told me he uses the same pair and I was sold!  I definitely look forward to working with David again for next year's ride.
SO58905|Tete is knowledgeable and very helpful. I am planning an extended bike tour, and Tete had some good ideas from personal experience, like clever camp site uses for the bike wash. 
SO58914|I'm writing regarding my recent order with Linda Mitchell. Often, orders like these from low-volume customers don't receive a lot of attention. However, I couldn't be more impressed with the professionalism and attention Linda provided us. Despite some availability issues, our order arrived in time and Linda kept us in the loop the whole time. Keep up the great work!

SO58938|My buddies and I were about to leave on a 2 week ride thru the Adirondacks when our trailer was robbed.  A frantic call to Adventure Works and an hour of Garrett's time and our trip was saved.  I would recommend this company to anyone.
SO58959|My AWC Logo Cap doesn't even fit.  I am surprised Pamela didn't tell me that they only come in one size.  I am definitely unhappy with my order.  Your sales reps aren't helpful either.
SO58963|The rep was very helpful, and executed my entire transaction without any errors. Delivery was prompt. However, I needed to return the LL Mountain Pedal 2 separate times; in both cases, the packaging had been damaged during shipping causing damage to the part. The plastic insulation doesn't seem to be solid enough to hold the part in place during shipping.
SO59026|Thanks for the great service and speed with which you are able to rush me such a large order. Thanks again to Garrett Vargas for her patience in helping me pick out a full package for my upcoming century ride! Note: just like you suggested, the women's tights worked very well to help me and my spare tire look much better in those spandex shorts!
SO59031|I had very high hopes for using AdventureWorks for my cycling needs based on their good prices.  My disappointed started the minute I needed support from a sales rep.  I consider myself reasonably knowledgeable on cycling but assumed the people at AdventureWorks would provide a level of expertise well beyond my own.  During my call, I felt like I was educating the sales rep more than he was helping me.  I know that there are always new hires that are learning, but AW needs to put them through much more rigorous training before putting them on the phone.  I will give them one final chance with a future order and hope for a real cyclist if I need support.
SO59044|Michael was a typical sales guy.  He was good but not great.  He seemed like he was in a rush to be rid of me.
SO59045|Not a happy camper :( Purchased the Mountain 300, 42 last week and it cracked on my first outing.  Called and the shop back and Jae was very helpful and confirmed it covered under warranty, but still a hassle to return. Any other cracking 300's out there?
SO59063|Thanks again to Jillian for helping expedite my order. all these products showed up at my store as promised in only 48 hours
SO59066|Stephen was incredibly helpful in helping me select the models, colors, and sizes of the bikes I ordered. The special discount he gave me on the AWC Logo Cap, which I had my eye on the entire time I was at the store, was very thoughtful. 
SO59068|Great job guys - my biggest order this year and it all arrived complete within 2 days.  Will definitely be buying again.
SO59074|Love those HL Road Handlebars, they are very comfortable for a long road ride
SO61184|Just a quick note to commend you on your excellent sales staff. I really did not know what to buy my kids for Christmas and Linda made it an easy and quick process. Well done.
SO61204|Rep was friendly, order delivery was prompt -- great job! Price was a little higher on some of the parts than my local store, but they just don't have your selection. 
SO61219|I love love love love my new crankset!  It's awesome!
SO61243|Dealing with Tsvi was great. The parts shipped in less than two weeks - just as I was about to run out of Road-650 frames.
SO65163|I wanted to let you know that Linda is going to be a great sales rep for you.  Even though she is new to Adventure Works and unfamiliar with all of the products, she has an awesome amount of energy and is very resourceful.  I was looking for the HL Crankset from 2 years ago since it has 2 inch wrench instead of 1.5 in this years model.  She looked high and low, talked to everyone and finally found one extra set in the basement storage.  She was sweating profusely by the time she was done.  I felt so guilty I bought an extra Blue HL Touring Frame!  She rocks

SO65209|There was a problem with my order - my shirt came the wrong size, I ordered large and it came as small.  Pamela was really helpful in sorting this out and apologized for wrong item being sent and had the shirt with the correct size delivered the following day.  I was impressed at the customer service provided to fix this problem.
SO65271|Linda, although highly professional, was unable to help be find the gloves I need.  I am unfortunately blessed with very wide fingers.  One would think I have a good grip on my handle bars but its actually the opposite.  My fingers are so wide I can't make a close fist with my hand.  Therefore, firmly gripping a handlebar is difficult and I need a glove that has some traction to the handle bars.  She suggested wrapping a pair of men's sport shorts around my hands, but I don't think that is a good idea.  Any help on a vendor I can reach out to that has fat finger glove would be appreciated.
SO65310|Jose did a great job explaining helping me come organize the various parts necessary for my bike, and even helped me coordinate the colors.
SO67294|I wish Linda had mentioned the number disadvantage of having a 4 bike hitch rack: when someone rear ends you, you can kiss 4 sweet bikes goodbye. Thanks, I've lost 3 good friends over this issue who had irreplaceable bikes. I should have listened to them when they urged me to pay the extra amount for a roof rack, but I listened to you instead.
SO67316|Very excited to user our new equipment and apparel.   We will definitely be back again and Jillian was extremely helpful.   I had some confusion on how to get the Minipump to work.  I got it working with Mens bikes but wasn't sure if it fit the valve for the Women's wheels.   The Half-finger gloves are great by the way.   No more blisters on our long rides.   Thanks again!
SO69393|So I just got my order today, thansk for the quick shipping...The HL Mountain Pedals are really sharp, I actually cut my finer taking them out of the box... if they tear through my shoes will you guys pay for a new pair?  My bike shoes are expensive and I really don't want to reck them on those pedals.. thoughts?

SO69442|Jilian was very helpful.  We had a pretty large and diverse order which ranged from 18 road bikes to a single cable lock, but Jilian did an excellent job putting up with us and tracking down what we needed.  We're opening our new shop this weekend! (The lock was actually for my daughter.  Shhh, don't tell anybody.)
SO69454|I had a long discussion with the rep about steel-vs-carbon frames. I came in a carbon skeptic, and walked out a lot less so.
SO69462|Jillian was able to get me totally kitted out to tackle the gnarliest mountain roads on the west coast; she was able to explain the difference in carbon frame manufacturing and walk me through the pros and cons of the Bellesi aluminium SIMO Road-250 versus the Battaglin Road-650 the monocoque fork and HL Road Handlebars.  After we settled on a great bike, she hooked me up with some really cool Perl Izumi women's tights (it gets cold in the mountains!).  I even got a cool set of Men's Bib-Shorts for my dad! I’m confident I’ll rock Tahoe Stage of the Amgen Tour of California ride this summer! 
SO69464|After speaking with Michael Blythe, I was excited to get my parts especially since he promised they would arrive in 2 days.  The parts ended up taking over a week to arrive and were not at all what I expected.  I am very disappointed and would not order from AdventureWorks again.  If you want good parts that arrive on-time, don't order from this website.
SO69475|Rachel was patient while I tried out all the different saddles.  Not knowing much about saddles, I wanted to make sure I test them all.  Rachel guided me throughout and provided knowledgeable advice.  One word of criticism: it would be nice if you included FedEx among your shipping options.
SO71833|Bill helped me as much as he could but we were unable to figure out why the rear wheel I bought did not fit my frame.
SO71902|I am very happy with all of the bike frames I purchased.  The Touring 3000 is especially good for hill climbs, so I'm pleased that our rep Tete recommended we try this frame has we hadn't bought one before and it is performing well.  Our only disappointment was that we ordered the HL Touring Seat/Saddle in blue and it arrived in fushia, which didn't suit the young man it was ordered for and had to be returned.
SO71952|Good pedals at a great price.  Also, good selection of socks.  But do not buy tubes from here--they sell patched tubes as new!
